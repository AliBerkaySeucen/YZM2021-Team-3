# Project Idea

Our goal is to create memory packages where you can store your memories in the form of photos and thoughts, and to bring the idea of a family album into the digital realm with extra features.

# Reason Behind This Idea

Nearly everyone has a family photo album at home, but these physical albums are vulnerable to damage. As anyone with a pet or young children knows, such keepsakes are rarely safe.

We aim to revolutionize this concept by integrating it with what we forget most easily—our thoughts—while also providing a way to connect and archive these memories, giving the family album a modern update.

# Core Features

Our application is built around three core features:

Memory Packages: Combining your photos with your personal thoughts and reflections.

Connections: The ability to link these memory packages together to form a narrative.

Archiving: A system for digitally filing and organizing your packages.

# Potential Users

The app's potential users are primarily families looking to document their children's milestones—such as their development, daily life, or first words—but it is also for anyone who wants a dedicated space to save their personal memories and thoughts.

# Use Cases

1. Capturing and Creating a Memory Package

A Parent :	I want to create a Memory Package for my child's first steps,	so that I can capture the photo, the date, and my personal thoughts about that special milestone before I forget the details.
An Individual :	I want to combine photos from my vacation with a written journal entry,	so that the visual memory and the emotional context are preserved together as a complete keepsake.
Any User :	I want to quickly add a 'thought' without an immediate photo, so that I can record a fleeting idea or conversation and link a relevant photo to it later.

2. Linking and Connecting Memories

A Family Member :	I want to link the 'First Day of School' Memory Package to the 'Graduation Day' Memory Package,	so that I can easily view the entire timeline and narrative of that major life event as one continuous story.
An Individual :	I want to create a connection between a memory from childhood and a related present-day reflection,	so that I can understand how my past experiences have shaped my current thoughts and feelings.
Any User :	I want to see all related Memory Packages in a chain or sequence,	so that I don't lose the context of a specific event and can follow the story from beginning to end.

3. Archiving and Retrieval

A Parent :	I want to digitally archive all Memory Packages related to 'Summer Vacation 2025' into a single folder,	so that I can keep my main timeline clean and quickly find all the memories from that specific trip later.
An Individual	: I want to use keywords and dates to search through my archived Memory Packages,	so that I can reliably find a specific memory or thought without having to manually scroll through everything.
Any User :	I want the application to securely store and back up all my Memory Packages,	so that my precious memories are safe from physical damage, lost phones, or computer crashes.
