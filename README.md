PROJECT IDEA

As you know, most of us have old family albums at home. We’ve all looked at them at least once. Don’t get me wrong—I love family albums myself. But the problem is, they can be hard to keep safe and organized. Your little brother might tear a page, or you might accidentally spill coffee on it. That’s why it makes much more sense to keep those memories online instead of in a fragile physical book.

But here’s the thing: traditional family albums only capture our photos. They don’t include our thoughts, our feelings, or the words that went through our minds at that exact moment. Our goal is not just to create a digital version of a family album—it’s to completely revolutionize the concept of an album.

This won’t just be another photo album. It will be your own customizable diary album. You’ll be able to save your memories with both photos and quotes from that day. You’ll also be able to categorize your memories, link them with other moments, and create connections between different experiences.

The most important difference between our application and anything else out there is this: it won’t just store photos. Each memory will become what we call a “memory package”—a combination of your photos, your ideas, and even your friends’ thoughts, all saved together.

As we all know, our ideas are fragile. They grow too quickly, and we forget them just as quickly. But with this application, you’ll finally have a way to capture and keep track of not only your memories, but also the thoughts and ideas that make those moments meaningful.
